- Include a link to your technical specs.


## GENERAL OVERVIEW
### (one page)

- Describe **what your project is about**.

Describe what kind of experience you intend to offer the audience, what drives you to make it, and what you think is interesting about it. This is the part of the document where you must capture the attention of your reader, so try to be as interesting and concise as possible.
- Describe **why this project is relevant to its medium.**

What is it about VR that will make it different than on a 2D screen, or as a physical performance? This is where you show the reader that you not only have a great idea, but that you also understand the technical aspects of the medium you're working in. Make sure you also mention why this is important as a social experience.
- Describe **the emotion that you want to suggest** in your audience.

Why would anyone want to experience your particular project, and what would they get out of it? Do they learn/reflect/play/challenge? Include how you will achieve that goal through *interaction design* and *spatial design*.
- **How and where do you see your project being experienced?**

In public, as a permanent installation, in a classroom, at home? How do you imagine someone's typical experience? This part should make the reader picture your project in the real world, and not just as an abstract idea. Perhaps you're applying for a particular setting or festival, but nothing prevents you from broadening those possibilities.
- Are there any **unusual aspects?**

Something that other projects in the same field don't have to take care of, but that you're experimenting with for the first time? Additional libraries, custom controllers, specific layout of the room in which the project will be presented, etc. This part is meant to show that you are not afraid to push boundaries of what exists, but that you are also aware of what you are doing.

## DESIGN OVERVIEW
#### (two pages)

- Describe **the fictional context** of your project.

Once the user lands in your world, where is she (e.g. nature, laboratory, bedroom, someone's mind?). What is the backstory of that virtual place, and what is the role of the user in that story? In addition to a concise backstory for the environment itself, you can also add one for the user herself. How do you use *patterns*, and *cognitive maps* to convey an idea?

- Describe **the core interaction(s)** of your project.

Why does the audience want to do that interaction? What is it interacting with? Why is it meaningful? How are you indicating it to them? What are the specific, detailed steps that the audience takes for the interaction to initiate and complete? What is the consequence of the interaction? How do you ensure that your interaction can be performed over and over and over without getting boring?

- Describe **the visual aesthetic** of your project.

What is the overall style (realistic, surrealistic, 8-bit, low-poly, etc.), and how does that style relate to the emotion you want to create? Along with it, describe how you intend to produce that art style (which software -Rhino, Photoshop-, which assets -thingiverse, asset store- and anything else -texture shaders, camera effects, generative techniques-).

- Describe **the sonic environment** of yous project.

What does the audience member hear? Group them in three overall categories: sound effects, interface sounds and music. What is their character (e.g. metallic, smooth, melodic, organic), and how does that character tie in to the overall experience you are trying to build? You should have specific examples.

- Describe **the interface** of your project.

How does the audience member interact with your project? How does the interface of your project allows her to understand what is going on and how to manipulate the state of the world? You should include sketches/wireframes of what the different interface elements should look like (e.g. potential titles, buttons, sliders, knobs). You should at least include one interface for joining your world, from the lobby room.

## EXPERIENCE OVERVIEW
#### (one page)

- Describe **the overall experience** of the audience member. How do they join? Where do they start? What would they typically do? How would they conclude their experience? Emphasize the important moments and the transition moments.

- Describe **a specific moment**. Try to be as precise and thorough as possible. Where does the audience member look? How do they move? What is going on in their head? What is a realistic, almost scientific depiction of the scene? How does the system look like at that moment? How does it evolve? This should be able to show the reader that you care about details and that you are not only thing in broad, abstract terms.

- Provide **a moodboard** that represents the atmosphere of your world. Select 10-15 images which represent the direction you're going for. They don't need to be images of assets you will use, but images that get you in the headspace for creating that world. Put them together in a single image file (using GIMP or Photoshop) and include the image here.
