## Hi!

If you are reading this, it means I still haven't managed to download the 2.4 GB repo. 
I cloned it in theory, but the damn thing shows me a blank folder with the .git metadata only.
I shall try again tonight, but until then, please use this link to a repo that doesn't take up 2.4 GB of space:

(P.S.: Assignment 2 is a WIP for my first project.)
