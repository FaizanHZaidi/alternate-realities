__Permanence__ is a project about the percieved static states of landscapes.
Designed as a meditation concept spin-off, it is also about patience.
The person experiencing the environment begins in a semi-revealed landscape.
Walls border the space, everything else hangs in a translucent quality.
That is, except for a patch of grass near the axis of view.
Observing the rock adds life to the space, it fills with color.
The ground branches out from center.
At this point the other rocks and trees of the environment can be revealed.
Observing each fills in a portion of the landscape texture from below the object.
After an amount of the environment has been observed, Ground Painting is unlocked.
The process should encourage the observer to explore the full environment.

    Ideally, the experience lasts beyond virtual reality:
    in the form of increased attention to daily details,
    and an appreciation for stillness.
