__Permanence__ is a virtual reality project guided by gaze input.
The user is fixed at a point in space, but allowed to look in all directions.
Gazing at (observing) the central rock will activate the space.
Other rocks and tree objects can now be detected by the user's gaze.
A durational (~2sec.) observance of these other objects will reveal their forms.

    A next step would be attaching the change in opacity to a lerp, to fade in.
    (See 01_Permanence/Assets/Scripts/TODO.cs for other future ideas.)

"Ground Painting" is unlocked by fully observing a set number (~20) of objects.
"Ground Painting" is added to the gaze input features.
A much larger area of the terrain can now be freely painted by looking at it.
It is up to the user to decide when they have seen enough.
Some may insist on revealing 100% of the environment.
Others may be satisfied with having a larger platform surrounding them.
There is no programmed 'end' to the project.
