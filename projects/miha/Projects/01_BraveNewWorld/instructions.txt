In addition to gaze rotation offered by the GVR Emulator (cmd+mouse), arrow keys can be used to move around space. When the user comes sufficiently close to the road (triggered by the road collider), an undischarged particle is chosen to seek interaction with the user. If the user looks in the direction of the particle as the latter is approaching the user, that is, if the particle collider is hit by the player’s recast manager, then the particle leaves the bounds of the road and hovers in close proximity to the user. The particle changes color from red to green upon continuous gazing, signaling a qualitative change in relationship. Alternatively, the particle’s color resets to red if the user breaks the visual connection and looks away from the particle. If the connection time between the user and the particle exceeds the particle’s attention threshold, the particle moves in front of the user relative to the road, and user movement is disabled. Thereafter, the user does not have a choice but to follow the particle, as the two hover back to the road and start traveling together.
