The project explores the theme of isolation and ways to overcome it. Specifically, I wanted to play with the insider/outsider dynamic, putting the user into a role where she can engage in a passive observation of a system from the outside, or actively interact with the system, thereby assuming the role of an insider. The system in this case is a stream of particles traveling along a fixed path. The user starts the experience on the side of the path, but can choose to move closer to the cluster of activity. Upon approaching the particle road, a single member leaves the stream and hovers in front of the user seeking for connection. If the user decides to maintain visual connection with the particle, the latter takes the user on a journey along the travel path. While travelling, the user is free to look around and explore the fresh perspective rendered possible by the newfound relationship between her and the particle.
