This game is an endless tunnel meant to embody the feeling of disgust. It is an endless tunnel that the player is slowly crawling through, intersected by bits of bones, tendon and eyes. The players gaze deforms the eyes and bones, the intention being to convey that they can sense and are shrinking away from the player's gaze. This is the only influence the player can have on this world. I drew inspiration from Lovecraftian horror and the idea of an unimaginably huge monster that has swallowed the player and whose insides they are passing through forever.
