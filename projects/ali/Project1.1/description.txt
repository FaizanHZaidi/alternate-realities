\f0\fs24 \cf0 The concept behind Project 1 is to have a first person shooter with a scary aspect, that is having to shoot spiders. This can also be used to fight fear as the spiders are large and the player feels good when he shoots them down. Unfortunately I could not get the spiders to function properly hence why I used cubes instead, but a spider is visible in the game.}
