The concept of the project

Virtual Reality aims to provide an immersive experience to its audience, primarily through the sense of sight. The sense of sight however, has its limitations. One can simply close his or her eyes and choose to disengage the self from the experience. To overcome this limitation and ensure that the audience remains engaged during the entire time, I chose to work with sound. Sound art is an often ignored form of art, especially in VR, despite being very potent. The environment that I therefore generated for this project was one where the individual was surrounded by noise: very loud and unpleasant noises aiming to induce anxiety. In order to eliminate the noises, the individual has to look at the source of the noise (a cube projecting some animation or a picture). This way, he or she is 'forced' to interact with the environment with the sense of sight, thanks to the sense of sound.
