## MILESTONES

### MILESTONE ALPHA - WEEK 10 - 04/05  
**Status**: We hope to have the game mechanics (gesture input, moving platforms) down by this time.  
**Interaction**: Working gesture mechanism that allows launch of object (Color feedback to users about ‘fit’ of gesture to defined template). A moving platform in the environment, potentially sin/cos orbits randomized with Perlin noise.  
**Technical Development**: Consistent asset appearance between players on the network. Only allow players to enter a multiplayer match if another player is available.  
**Media assets**: Textures for rocks, the environment, fire, avatars for players

### MILESTONE BETA - WEEK 12 - 04/19  
**Status**: A working prototype that you can play and have fun. Have a basic, functioning environment that is able to interact with the player, and the player with it. Also, finish up the work on the player: add a working health bar and a stamina bar.  
**Interaction**: Have a visible avatar for the player which presents a shadow with the lighting. The environment is interactable - adding some components that are interactable.  
**Technical Development**: Gesture recognition and platform behavior refined by user testing.  
**Media assets**: Lava/fireball prefabs with particle effects. Environmental details hinting at prior battles.

### MILESTONE GOLD - WEEK 14 - 05/01  
**Status**: User testing complete (several rounds), feedback incorporated. Polished environment, fun gameplay, a tree of ‘secret’ gestures.  
**Interaction**: Have everything finished: the environment along with all its assets and graphics, ability to power up using the environment  
**Technical Development**: Stable build. Story incorporated.  
**Media assets**: Audio, background, and lobby music. Mountains crash in the background, other players can be see fighting in the distance. All the proper wooshes, spits of lava, crispy fireballs.
