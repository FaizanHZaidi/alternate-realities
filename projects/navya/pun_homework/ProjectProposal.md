**Group members**: Faizan, Navya and Tavius  
**Technical Specifications**: [Technical Specifications](https://github.com/navyasuri/PUNtrial/blob/master/TechnicalSpecifications.md)

## Project Overview

**Describe what your project is about**. Describe what kind of experience you intend to offer the audience, what drives you to make it, and what you think is interesting about it. This is the part of the document where you must capture the attention of your reader, so try to be as interesting and concise as possible.  
- Water, Earth, Fire, Air. If you were an element, which would you be?  
- Bringing Avatar: The Last Airbender to life. Gives (players/users/those who experience) the ability to harness the power of their element. A proper homage, we intend to transport (players) to a realm often pondered. Part telekinetic ability, part (something else), it gives (you/users) the power to do something always wanted to do.  
- It exists in contemporary media: the force in Star Wars, (other superhero movies, which are reaching fever pitch).  
- Agency to do something beyond real life.

**Describe why this project is relevant to its medium**. What is it about VR that will make it different than on a 2D screen, or as a physical performance? This is where you show the reader that you not only have a great idea, but that you also understand the technical aspects of the medium you're working in. Make sure you also mention why this is important as a social experience.  
- The immersive nature of virtual reality allows the experience to flow naturally (e.g. users positioned on suspended, moving platforms will think they’re actually on such a platform, or instinctively defend themselves when an attack is headed their way etc).  
- Study the users motion to inform the feedback. 1-to-1 user actions are reinforced by their experience in the headset and with haptic feedback from the controllers. The only piece we’ll be missing by the end is the heat of the flames.  
- Example: measuring distance from the headset to the controllers to determine gesture recognition.  
- Fire performers exist in the real world, but to handle the heat takes extensive training. Pulling this off in virtual space offers an instant skill set.  
- A core plot device of Avatar is progressing through shared knowledge, seeking out masters of the elements to learn how to control the forces of nature firsthand. Anyone familiar with virtual reality should know the moment when somebody passes the headset over with a, “Check this out.” There will be no watching for awe from the sidelines here. As a multiplayer experience the barrier of switching headset is dropped, friends can show each other newly discovered gestures from within the world of Avatar.

**Describe the emotion that you want to suggest in your audience**. Why would anyone want to experience your particular project, and what would they get out of it? Do they learn/reflect/play/challenge? Include how you will achieve that goal through interaction design and spatial design.  
- For each individual, the experience will be personal and different. But generally, we feel that people will get a sense of excitement and awe when they play the game. Exciting because of obtaining superpowers (controlling the elements) and interacting with the opponent and the environment.  
- The game is meant to be a challenge, as well as a learning opportunity. The learning happens with players making sense of their environment, harnessing its power and coming to a better understanding of their abilities to use them more naturally. This is, in a way, a challenge as well, especially when that learning happens during a fight with one or more opponents.  
- Spatial: utilizing the environment to reinforce the idea of elements as forces of nature. The players will interact with these ‘ambient’ sources of energy by either utilizing them to power up or fending them off.  
- This is a lived-in world, the knowledge of the elements steeped in ancient history. Players will hold combat in an arena where the greatest warriors have trained. Mountains in the distance are cracked in half from epic battles, (etc, storytelling details).  
- Interaction: Environment can be ‘damaged’ or otherwise changed by the players. When a boulder is pulled from the ground a crater appears. If the attack misses and hits a stone column, that breaks and falls, offering new material to bend with.   
- The gestures are the interaction input, ideally the user finds a flow, feeling in sync with the element. Given an initial set of attack and defense gestures, the users gain agency through discovery and sharing of new gestures, building a more complex set of moves. Competing for master of an element is what will drive players towards the conclusion of the experience.

**Are there any unusual aspects?** Something that other projects in the same field don't have to take care of, but that you're experimenting with for the first time? Additional libraries, custom controllers, specific layout of the room in which the project will be presented, etc. This part is meant to show that you are not afraid to push boundaries of what exists, but that you are also aware of what you are doing.  
- Gestures as the key game mechanic. Players will be able to “draw” certain patterns by the motion of the controllers, and these patterns will serve as input for the game. E.g. if a player draws a circle with the controller, it will launch an attack in the game.   
- Players have the affordance to move within their room-scale space. To eliminate to concern of teleporting or running away from combat, they will battle on floating platforms corresponding to their chosen element (slabs of rock, supportive clouds, etc).  
- Possibility of discovering gestures.
