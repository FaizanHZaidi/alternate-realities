Concept

This emotion that I chose to explore in this project is frustration. As such, it as an expression of hopelessness; and what it feels
like when you believe and are told that you must have hope, but it doesn't seem like that hope is realistic. 
It's a cynical take on the 'look for the light at the end of the tunnel' quote, and so is a tunnel which infinitely gets larger (and at an increasing rate),
with the light consistently getting farther away. As time passes, the player moves faster and the tunnel's colors change (gradually to a lighter tone, 
and then loops), to give a false sense that things are changing, yet the light never gets closer.
