“Eye see you” is an exploration of anxiety, an emotion I’m very familiar with. My goal was to make people who interact with the environment I created feel like they are surrounded by people who are looking at them and laughing at them. This idea came from my own struggles with social anxiety. When I meet new people in a new environment I can sometimes feel like all eyes are on me and I feel trapped. However,  I’ve learned how to manage that anxiety so I wanted to introduce an element of hope to the experience by allowing users to lower the volume of the audio every time they stare straight into an eye and face their anxiety.
